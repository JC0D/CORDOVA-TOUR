                <p>
                    Like most of the towns in the Province of Cebu, Cordova also got its name after a place in Spain. 
                    It was Governor General Rafael Echague who created this town (composed of the barrios of Gabi, Day-as, and Pilipul) on May 22, 1863. 
                    He chose the name Cordova which means "stark nakedness and bare". 
                    Spain, Mexico and Argentina and the six states of the United States of America - Alaska, South Carolina, Illinois, Alabama, New Mexico, & Tennessee have cities also named Cordova. 
                    The creation of Cordova into a separate Municipality in 1863 was short-lived. When the Americans replaced the Spaniards, Cordova was re-absorbed by the Municipality of Opon, now Lapu-Lapu City. 
                    On January 01, 1913, Cordova became a Municipality again by virtue of Orden Ejecutiva Numero 96 issued by US Governor General Newton W. Gilbert on December 17, 1912. 
                    This is how Cordova became a Municipality. In this site, it is not only the history of Cordova that will be disclosed but also other beautiful and wonderful tourism spots and nature's park will be featured. 
                    So come, explore, experience and rediscover CORDOVA, CEBU!
