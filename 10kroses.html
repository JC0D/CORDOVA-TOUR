                            The garden alone is a pretty sight, with guests from all around Cebu eager to witness the mesmerizing view. 
                            Taking selfies in front of the unique flower arrangement or walking along the garden are some of the usual things they do during their visit. 

                            Of course, other than that, they also order food and drinks inside the cafe.
                            
                            The outdoor dining area offers an open view of the sea and is spacious enough to walk around. 
                            Whether you’re alone or with family and friends, the place serves as a great distraction from work or school.  
                            
                            The cafe’s menu includes Italian-inspired dishes like pizza, pasta, and panini, with a selection of beverages like coffee, shakes, and tea. 
                            The best time to visit the cafe is late afternoon towards evening, since this is when the roses begin to light up. The sunset adds to its appeal, and the roses look much better at night. 

                            Some people find themselves staying a while longer just to enjoy the scenery with their loved ones. 
                            While there are a lot of establishments that offer good food and ambiance, this particular cafe in Cebu makes every visit a worthwhile experience.

                            You may compare it with the Sirao Flower Garden in Barangay Sirao or Buwakan ni Alejandra in Balamban, but instead of a vast garden of different types of real, colorful flowers, you have a landscape of 10000 white LED roses that come to life at night.

                            The experience might be different for some, but one thing’s for sure: the 10000 Roses Cafe is a sight to behold. 

                            Whether you’ll be visiting for the food, ambiance, or view, the place makes a great escape from the bustling city life. Even first time visitors are fascinated with what this beautiful cafe has to offer.

                    The 10,000 roses cafe is located at the end of Cordova Tourism Center, just right next to Lantaw Floating Restaurant. 
                    It is owned by Miguel Cho, an interior designer. 
                    He was inspired by the famous Dongdaenum Design Plaza in South Korea. 
                    His intention in putting up the cafe is to create a romantic ambience that would be perfect for couples, a place precise for a beginning of a happily ever after.

                    Aside from the sumptuous food in the cafe, the main attraction of the place is the 10,000 artificial LED roses that are “planted” in the open area of the facility. 
                    These roses of about 3 feet tall dance with the sea breeze in the day time and are transformed into magical lights in the night as they are lit at around 6pm every night.

                    The cafe itself has a viewing deck that can offer a completely amazing view of the Cebu Island, the sea, and of course, the flowers. 
                    It is a perfect spot for photographers to capture a marvelous picture of the whole area without them getting stuck in the crowd.
                    Going to the cafe was initially free. 
                    One can go to the place and take a handful of pictures even without dining at the cafe. 
                    But since a vast of visitors came and the crowd became uncontrollable, some of the roses got destroyed and need to be replaced and garbage were spotted being thrown in the sea. 
                    So the Cordova Tourism Office decided to charge a very minimal fee per visitor. It is an environmental fee to maintain the cleanliness of the area and to protect the water surrounding it.
