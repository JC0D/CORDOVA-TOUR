                    It was on October 8,1864 that Cordova was made an independent town and parish by a diocesan decree under the advocation of San Roque. The parish has been administered for some time by Recollect fathers.

Jose Baztan was one responsible for the reconstruction of the church made of mortar with pebbles and tabique pampango or wooden harigues. Fr. Baztan, a very holy priest who had always dreamed of volunteering for the China mission, was assassinated at the plaza of Opon by Cebuano insurgents on April 4, 1898. They threw his cadaver in the sea.
                    Fr. Pedro Medina built the convent of masonry and wood in 1891. Both church and convent maintain their original form, except for a few restorations made recently.
